## Races

### Race 2 – 10K The Buckyball Way for Special Effect

The AutoSplitter will start the timer once you undock from the station "Nye Terminal"   
Since the order in which you visit the race’s stops is up to you, the splits do not have a specific order and instead just list the nth stop.   


### Race 1 – Time And Motion Study
